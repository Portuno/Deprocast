# Calendar Improvements

## Overview
The calendar has been significantly improved to fix visualization issues and integrate with the database for real data instead of fake mock data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Integration
- **New Table**: Created `calendar_events` table in Supabase
- **Real Data**: Replaced fake "This Week" statistics with actual database queries
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality for calendar events

### 2. Visualization Fixes
- **Reduced Cell Heights**: Calendar cells now use `h-16` instead of `h-24` to fit without scrolling
- **Optimized Spacing**: Reduced padding and margins throughout the calendar
- **Compact Layout**: Better use of space while maintaining readability
- **Responsive Design**: Calendar adapts better to different screen sizes

### 3. New Features
- **Event Creation**: Click "New Event" button or double-click on a date to create events
- **Event Form**: Comprehensive form with title, date, time, type, duration, and description
- **Real-time Updates**: Calendar refreshes automatically when events are created
- **Date Selection**: Click to select a date, double-click to create an event for that date

### 4. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE calendar_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  time TIME NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('task', 'meeting', 'break', 'focus')),
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
  description TEXT,
  duration_minutes INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### 5. API Functions
- `createCalendarEvent()` - Create new events
- `getCalendarEventsByDateRange()` - Fetch events for a date range
- `getCalendarEventStats()` - Get statistics for the week
- `updateCalendarEvent()` - Update existing events
- `deleteCalendarEvent()` - Delete events

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations
Execute these SQL files in order:
```bash
# 1. Create the calendar_events table
supabase/006_create_calendar_events_table.sql

# 2. (Optional) Insert sample data for testing
supabase/007_insert_sample_calendar_events.sql
```

### 2. Update Sample Data
After running the sample data file, replace `'your-user-id-here'` with your actual user ID:
```sql
-- Get your user ID
SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;

-- Update the sample data with your user ID
UPDATE calendar_events 
SET user_id = 'your-actual-user-id' 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id-here';
```

## Usage

### Creating Events
1. Click the "New Event" button, or
2. Double-click on any date in the calendar
3. Fill out the event form
4. Click "Create Event"

### Viewing Events
- Events are displayed as colored badges in calendar cells
- Different colors represent different event types:
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Tasks
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple: Meetings
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Focus Sessions
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Breaks

### Statistics
The "This Week" section now shows real data:
- Total Events
- Meetings count
- Focus Sessions count
- Tasks count
- Breaks count

## Technical Details

### Components
- `Calendar.tsx` - Main calendar component with database integration
- `EventForm.tsx` - Modal form for creating/editing events

### State Management
- Real-time data fetching with useEffect
- Loading states for better UX
- Automatic refresh after event creation

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for database errors
- Console logging for debugging
- Loading states during data fetching

## Future Enhancements
- Event editing and deletion
- Drag and drop event scheduling
- Recurring events
- Event notifications
- Calendar sharing
- Integration with external calendar services
